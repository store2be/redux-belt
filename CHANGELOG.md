## Unreleased

## [0.3.0] - 2017-07-20
* 🔨 Introduce crudReducer configurability
Breaking changes:
- The `metaData` key in the default `crudReducer` is now `meta`.
- The `deleting` key in the `loading` object in the state is now `delete`.
- The shape of the state generated by `crudReducer` is defined by `extractors`, which default to mapping an action's `payload` to their key in the state.
- We now offer a `configureCrudReducer` builder, in which a user can specify their own `extractor`s for each state key.
- 🚚 Rename `actionsNamespace` to `actions`
- 🚚 Rename `crudActionsNamespace` to `actionsIncludingCrud`
